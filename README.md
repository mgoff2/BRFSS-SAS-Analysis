# BRFSS-SAS-Analysis
Course project on SAS using public CDC data


There is extensive annotation and commenting throughout the program to describe the process of thinking I took. 

Largely, topics deal with variable redefinition based on factor, some simple visualizations, and some processing for risk ratio analysis. 

The actual SAS file doesn't convert perfectly, but at the bottom there is an additional later-added template using Proc Template that makes some much better graphics than the original program produced.
